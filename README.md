# DA-project_1
My first Data analysis project on Covid 19 pandemic inspired by #30daysoflearning
# Project Overview
Covid 19 is a communicable disease that is caused by a novel corona virus. The world has never been the same since it was declared a pandemic. This project consists of a dashboard and analysis of scraped data. This report is intended to give a summarized information like total confirmed cases, total death cases and total death rate amongst others.

# Data Sourcing
The data sets used was scraped from a public repository that gives daily updates on Covid 19 by the Center for Science and Systems Engineering (CSSE) at John Hopkins. https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series
# Data Cleaning 
The data sets were transformed with the use of power query in Excel. The first step involved was to remove the column section from the dialog box when source setting is selected, check for the correct data type of each field and finally unpivot other columns with date as column headers.
Pivot tables were created for easy analysis of data with the creation of some calculated fields.
# Findings and Recommendation
After analyzing the data, the death rate of covid 19 was discovered to have reduced gradually since 2020. The month of August, January and December was noticed to have the highest confirmed cases which might be caused by increased social activities during the holiday season.
It is quite stunning to discover that four of the top five countries with the highest recovery rate is from the continent of Asia where the pandemic originated from.
I will recommend that we make conscious efforts in protecting ourselves from the pandemic because a 1% decrease in death rate was recorded between 2020 and 2021 and a 0.86% is being recorded between last year till date. This implies that the difference in death rate has slightly dropped.
